# MarsXI Theme (Twenty Seventeen Child)

`Version 1.0.0`



A child theme of the [Twenty Seventeen WordPress Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/). Built specifically for a South Korean startup that is working in the Underground Construction space. Second rendition of a website theme for the company. The first is a Child Theme of Oblique.

### Description
This is a Child Theme of Twenty Seventeen with additional Customizer Options for more control over Home page options.

### Features
Global:

- Top Menu Bar selection: Top or Bottom of each page
- Logo selection: over the Header or in the Top Menu
- Site Headline (optional): visible on ALL pages or just the Front Page
- Call to Action (optional): visible on ALL pages or just the Front Page
- Highlight Color: applies to text (`highlight-text`), lines and borders (`highlight-line`), and shapes (`highlight-bg`) throughout the site with those specific classes assigned to them

Front Page:

- Page Layout Option: slide-in Featured images (similar to Box.com style)
- Front Page Layout (issues): same options as Page Layout, but may differ independently and applies to the Front Page and LAST Section panels only
- Front Page FIRST and LAST Section (issues): layout may be applied independently from the Page Layout selection of the other panels (same as Front Page Layout)

Still working out the Issues with Front Page independent layouts - in the Customizer preview as well as front-page.php
